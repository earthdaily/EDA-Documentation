<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://console.earthdaily.com/mosaics"><strong>EarthMosaics</strong></a> delivers cloud-free, temporally coherent mosaics with ​the highest possible geolocation, radiometric ​quality, enabling users to examine true signals, minimize false positives in change detection, and easily contextualize with other geospatial datasets. From analysing a regional forest to monitoring a mining site, predicting water reservoir levels to measuring melting permafrost, EarthMosaics (now in beta) offers application-specific and customized insights fulfilling unique needs of each use case.</p>

<p>AI Ready Mosaics are complex, costly to produce, and designed to feed directly into ML applications​.</p>

<p><a href="https://console.earthdaily.com/mosaics">EarthMosaics</a>  from EarthDaily Analytics provides you a way to explore and get a free preview and you can also place orders for full resolution Mosaics.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started-with-mosaics">Getting started with Mosaics</h2>

<p>Below is the landing page you see when you navigate to <a href="https://console.earthdaily.com/mosaics">EarthMosaics</a></p>

<p><img src="/Images/EarthMosaicsUI/WelcometoMosaic.png" alt="WelcomeMosaics" /></p>

<p>When you are the first time user, you get the Welcome dialog with an option to GetStarted</p>

<p>Pressing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GetStarted</code> will take you to a NewOrders page. Let’s see what are all the options we have while placing the order:</p>

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>S. No</th>
      <th>Label</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/Images/NumberLabels/One.png" alt="One" /></td>
      <td>Area of Interest (AOI)</td>
      <td>You can start drawing a polygon for your Mosaics order. The limit currently is &lt; 100,000 km<sup>2</sup></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/Images/NumberLabels/Two.png" alt="Two" /></td>
      <td>Instead of drawing a polygon, if you have an existing GeoJSON, you have an option to enter it here. The restriction of &lt; 100,000 km<sup>2</sup> applies to this too</td>
      <td> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/Images/NumberLabels/Three.png" alt="Three" /></td>
      <td>Time of Interest</td>
      <td>Specify the time of interest for your Mosaics order</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/Images/NumberLabels/Four.png" alt="Four" /></td>
      <td>Settings</td>
      <td>This one gives you multiple choices to place your order as per your needs</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

<p>The area of interest (AOI) defines the geographic extent used to build the mosaic. You can either draw the AOI on the map or provide the AOI’s GeoJSON below. To draw, start by left-clicking on the map. After adjusting the extent of your AOI, complete the AOI by left-clicking. Once drawn, you can select your AOI to reshape its boundaries.</p>

<p><img src="/Images/EarthMosaicsUI/AoI.png" alt="AoI" /></p>

<p>Once you draw a polygon, you will see the area calculator diaplays the total area selected by you. You will see three options appear</p>

<h2 id="mosaic-preview-order">Mosaic Preview Order</h2>
<p>The settings define how your mosaic will be generated.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Resolution determines the quality of your mosaic: Preview is free, whereas Full is paid. You are advised to first create a Preview Resolution mosaic, with your desired settings, to preview your order.</li>
  <li>Processing type determines the pixel selection process:
    <ul>
      <li>Best Measurement uses pixel-by-pixel weighting</li>
      <li>Peak NDVI uses Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI) (Coming Soon)</li>
      <li>Peak Burn Severity uses Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and (Coming Soon)</li>
      <li>Percentile uses a common pixel approach.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Source specifies if your mosaic will be made using only Sentinel-2 or the combination of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8/9.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/Images/EarthMosaicsUI/Settings.png" alt="Settings" /></p>

<p>Now, after you confirm all settings, submit the order</p>

<p><img src="/Images/EarthMosaicsUI/Submit.png" alt="Submit" /></p>

<h2 id="mosaic-full-resolution-order">Mosaic Full resolution Order</h2>

<p>Mosaics Full Resolution Order is very similar to the preview except that it has an additional step for payment.</p>

<p>As you will notice in the above images, the Preview order has mainly 2 steps</p>
<ul>
  <li>Configuration</li>
  <li>Confirmation</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, the Full Resolution Mosaic has an additional step</p>
<ul>
  <li>Quote</li>
</ul>

<p>To place the Full resolution Mosaics order you will primarily use “Full” as your Resolution setting as shown below</p>

<p><img src="/Images/EarthMosaicsUI/FullResOrder.png" alt="FullResOrder" /></p>

<p>Please confirm the order settings in order to checkout</p>

<p><img src="/Images/EarthMosaicsUI/Checkout.png" alt="Checkout" /></p>

<p>The checkout screen below shows you the order price. If you are ready to pay, go ahead and chekout to get to the payment page below.</p>

<p><img src="/Images/EarthMosaicsUI/Pay.png" alt="Pay" /></p>

<p>If you have any coupons to redeem, you can enter the coupon code in order to get the eligible discount. Once you are ok with total amount and have entered relevant payment details, please proceed to pay</p>

<h2 id="managing-mosaics-orders">Managing Mosaics Orders</h2>

<p>Once you have placed the Mosaic order (either Preview or Full), you will be redirected to your Dashboard where you can see all your orders.</p>

<p><img src="/Images/EarthMosaicsUI/AllOrdersFull.png" alt="AllOrdersFull" /></p>

<p>Upon submission, you will see that your order is in Processing state. There is a button on top right of the panel if you want to View all of your Mosaic Orders</p>

<p><img src="/Images/EarthMosaicsUI/AllOrders.png" alt="AllOrders" /></p>

<p>The orderId you see in this page can be found as a LineItemId in your Account Information page under “MyOrders”</p>

<p><img src="/Images/EarthMosaicsUI/MyOrders.png" alt="MyOrders" /></p>

<p>Once the order is processed successfully, you will see the state changed to “Processed” and some other options enabled for the order</p>

      <td>This option allows you to copy the order in case you want to use the same settings or have a minor modification to place another order</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/Images/NumberLabels/Nine.png" alt="Nine" /></td>
      <td>Download</td>
      <td>This is where you can download your product - preview or full</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/Images/NumberLabels/Ten.png" alt="Ten" /></td>
      <td>View</td>
      <td>This option allows you to view the product in the Visualizer which is very similar to the EarthPlatform UI</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Below is the Visualizer that opens up when you click on the View button on the Orders page. This visualizer is very similar to our EarthPlatform UI and has many common components needed to interact with the Mosaic product similar to our other products</p>

<p><img src="/Images/EarthMosaicsUI/Visualizer.png" alt="Visualizer" /></p>

<p>That is it !! Happy Mosaicking !!</p>
