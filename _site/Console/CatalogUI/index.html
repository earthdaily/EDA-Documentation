<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Customers can get access to our image catalog and products through EarthPlatform. It is a portal where the user can browse through our minimally processed catalog items. In addition to provide useful metadata and details about the listed images, it provides capabilities to interact with the scene content and order a high resolution product for selected catalog items. You can access the <a href="https://console.earthdaily.com/platform">EarthPlatform</a> by appending the endpoint /catalog to the base URL.</p>

<h2 id="search">Search</h2>
<p>EarthPlatform has search panel with various options to customize your search. Lets have a look at them.</p>

<p>Once you login with your credentials, the landing page for EarthPlatform is shown below</p>

<p>Below is the example of the Item Properties as shown on the right</p>

<p><img src="/Images/CatalogUI/ItemProperties.png" alt="EarthPlatform Item Properties" /></p>

<p>Click on the “Show Full“ to pop up a form that will show the text and JSON format of the STAC item properties as below</p>

<p><img src="/Images/CatalogUI/ShowFull.png" alt="EarthPlatform Show Full" /></p>

<p>Display Mode : Text below. This comes really handy when you want to get the STAC details of the given image/item. You can also get the individual asset urls and download the images as shown below in the “href”</p>

<p><img src="/Images/CatalogUI/ShowFulltext.png" alt="EarthPlatform Show Full Text" /></p>

<p>Here is the image showing the JSON format of the item properties. This is very useful when you want to get the whole or part of JSON and use it in your own application for several purposes.</p>

<p><img src="/Images/CatalogUI/ShowFulljson.png" alt="EarthPlatform Show Full JSON" /></p>

<p>Here is the example of tagging an item as favorite and then toggle the View favorite to see only the favorites list</p>

<p>Below is the example where two images are selected and viewed on the map. Auto visualization was enabled for the right hand side image and you can see the difference it makes.</p>

<p>Next, we can see how we can compare two images over a period of time to see how the landscape is changing. We can do this by using Map Slider</p>

<p>Below there are two images chosen over the same area but with different dates “2022/03/15“ and “2022/03/23“. They have been tagged favorite (with view favorite list enabled) and View on Map enabled to be able to see the landscape details.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>S. No.</th>
      <th>Label</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/Images/NumberLabels/TwentyThree.png" alt="TwentyThree" /></td>
      <td>Show/ Hide Map Slider</td>
      <td>This is the toggle for Map Slider. It gives you a capability to slide the area from left to right. Specially useful when you have two images, one on the left and one on the right. As you slide you will be able to see the landscape changes given the images are of different dates.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/Images/NumberLabels/TwentyFour.png" alt="TwentyFour" /></td>
      <td>Move Image Left</td>
      <td>Click this L button to select the image to be seen on the left of the image</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/Images/NumberLabels/TwentyFive.png" alt="TwentyFive" /></td>
      <td>Move Image Right</td>
      <td>Click this R button to select the image to be seen on the right of the image</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/Images/NumberLabels/TwentySix.png" alt="TwentySix" /></td>
      <td>Slider</td>
      <td>The slider</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><img src="/Images/CatalogUI/MapSlider.png" alt="EarthPlatform Map Slider" /></p>

<p>Below are the differences over a particular area which shows the installation of the solar panels that happened within a few days (from 2022/03/15 to 2022/03/23)</p>

<p><img src="/Images/CatalogUI/MapSliderLeft.png" alt="EarthPlatform Map Slider Left" /></p>

<p><img src="/Images/CatalogUI/MapSliderRight.png" alt="EarthPlatform Map Slider Right" /></p>

<p>Now, there are some slider options to help you see the relative difference or similarity between the image and the base-map.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>S. No.</th>
      <th>Label</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/Images/NumberLabels/TwentySeven.png" alt="TwentySeven" /></td>
      <td>Image Opacity</td>
      <td>Image Opacity is used if you want to check location or any other attribute relative to the basemap.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/Images/NumberLabels/TwentyEight.png" alt="TwentyEight" /></td>
      <td>Image Footprint Opacity</td>
      <td>As a query result, the more footprints you have the darker the footprints get until you can’t see the ground. So Image Footprint Opacity helps to make the image footprint transparent and then you can find your location.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/Images/NumberLabels/TwentyNine.png" alt="TwentyNine" /></td>
      <td>Wetland Prediction Opacity</td>
      <td>This is useful when you have a landcover raster rendered for wetland prediction. Once you have rendered the landcover classification, you can use this transparency level to compare with the image background and avoid rendering every time.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/Images/NumberLabels/Thirty.png" alt="Thirty" /></td>
      <td>Wetland Prediction</td>
      <td>It renders render the landcover classification for the image. It shows dark green for forest, yellow for crops, cyan for wetland and blue for water. One thing to note is that you need to have the Image Opacity at 0% for the wetland classification to be visible.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><img src="/Images/CatalogUI/ImageSliders.png" alt="EarthPlatform Image Sliders" /></p>

<p>Below you can see the opacity for the image at 100%, 50% and 0</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Image Opacity 0</th>
      <th>Image Opacity 50</th>
      <th>Image Opacity 100</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/Images/CatalogUI/ImageOpacity0.png" alt="ImageOpacity0" /></td>
      <td><img src="/Images/CatalogUI/ImageOpacity50.png" alt="ImageOpacity50" /></td>
      <td><img src="/Images/CatalogUI/ImageOpacity100.png" alt="ImageOpacity100" /></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Here is an example of the Footprint opacity</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Footprint Opacity High</th>
      <th>Footprint Opacity Low</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/Images/CatalogUI/FootprintOpacityHigh.png" alt="FootprintOpacityHigh" /></td>
      <td><img src="/Images/CatalogUI/FootprintOpacityLow.png" alt="FootprintOpacityLow" /></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Now, lets see when wetland prediction is enabled for images, how does the opacity slider work. Examples at 100% and 20%</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Wetland Opacity High</th>
      <th>Wetland Opacity Low</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/Images/CatalogUI/WetlandOpacityHigh.png" alt="WetlandOpacityHigh" /></td>
      <td><img src="/Images/CatalogUI/WetlandOpacityLow.png" alt="WetlandOpacityLow" /></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>That completes the list of our extensive operations that can be done with the Catalog images.</p>
